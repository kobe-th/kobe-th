- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kobe-th
- ðŸŽ“ I'm a PhD student in computational literary studies, applying data analysis and Large Language Models to a corpus of late medieval songs. My goal is to develop a data-driven framework for studying the formal and thematical similarities between literary texts, with the goal of advancing research on intertextuality, genre evolution and literary networks.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Natural Language Processing, Data Analysis, Data Visualization
